                    <h2> Details </h2>
                    <p> In order to develop the sneaker app, it was imperative to establish connectivity with the MariaDB database 
                        via an SSH tunnel. Once this connection was established, we proceeded to craft queries utilizing MySQL and 
                        completed the backend logic using Java. Eclipse served as our chosen framework for development, while MySQL 
                        Workbench facilitated database management. </p>
                </div>
    
                <div> 
                    <h2> Team Work </h2>
                    <p> My project collaborator demonstrated exceptional dedication and contributed significantly to our joint efforts. 
                        Working with Java proved to be particularly advantageous due to its versatility, allowing for the attainment of desired functionality 
                        through various approaches. I found paired programming to be highly beneficial, as the collaborative nature ensured thoroughness 
                        in our coding endeavors by leveraging the collective insight of two minds. 
                    </p>

                    <h2> Time Frame </h2>
                    <p> We had about 3 weeks to finsih this project. Took about 1 week to finish setting everything up
                        including an ssh tunnel so that we could connect to the database without running into a firewall.
                        Then the last 2 weeks working on queries and tightening everything up. </p>
