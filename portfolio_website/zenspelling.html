                    <h2> Details </h2>
                    <p> This was a spelling game designed for 1st - 5th graders. It is a fun and interactive
                        game where students are able to drag and drop appealing tiles and are then prompted
                        to choose the correct form of spelling. Each student has their own profile and teachers are also 
                        able to login through the teacher portal.
                    </p>

                    <p> This was a team project made up of 4 developers. I was one of the main developers working with 
                        another developer, a qulaity assurance engineer, and a Git Maven who was in charge of version control.

                    <p> The project was broken up into 3 iterations. Each iteration was around 3 weeks and was an entire semester long 
                        project. After each iteration, we were required to present our product in its present state to our client.  </p>
