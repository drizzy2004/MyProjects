                    <h2> Details </h2>
                    <p> This web application was completed using the DJANGO framework. We used CSS, HTML, a little Python
                        and JavaScript. We worked with a real client and made sure to deliver what she wanted for her business. </p>

                    <h2> Team Work </h2>
                    <p> This was a team project. I worked with 3 other developers and 3 designers. It was a very 
                        interesting class and very benficial because I got to work with people who had another area of
                        expertise.

                    <p> This was an entire semester project. It took a lot of work and even more time trying schedule 
                        meetings with our client. </p>
