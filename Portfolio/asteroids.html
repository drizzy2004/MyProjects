                    <h2> Details </h2>
                    <p> This is a replication of the retro game Asteroids. It was a final project for my Data Structures class. 
                        I used many data structures in this project including stacks, array-lists, queues, and linked-lists. Also implemented
                    multiple classes which helped better my understanding of the logic behind the data structures. </p>

                    <h2> Individual Project </h2>
                    <p> This was a solo project because it wasn't a super challenging project. It did take time and effort,
                        but was probably easier to work on individually.  
                    </p>

                    <h2> Time Frame </h2>
                    <p> The project was broken up into 4 iterations. Each part was due 1 week apart from each other, so in total the Project
                        took around 4-5 weeks to complete. It was a time-consuming task, but really worth it. It was extremely fun to play.  </p>
